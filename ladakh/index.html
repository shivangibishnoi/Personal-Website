        <p>Necessity used to be the mother of invention, at least, when human demands were simpler. Then capitalism happened. 
            In the Himalayan cold desert of Ladakh, Sonam Wangchuk has worked for decades to solve true problems. Some, if not all, fell to Ladakh as a result of climate change. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Ladakh is known for two things in India- a surreal natural beauty that seems as if untouched by the ugliness of human excesses, and the Kargil conflict between India and Pakistan in 1999. More recently Kargil has been replaced with the Siachen glacier- a point of dispute between India and China. 
            Between the extremes of war and tourism, Ladakh is forgotten. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Political amnesia plays no small part in it. When the political and administrative status of Jammu and Kashmir was changed from a state to Union Territory in 2019, <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/why-is-ladakh-divided-over-supreme-court-verdict-upholding-article-370-abrogation-11702470714273.html">Ladakh was promised a protected status under the sixth schedule of the Indian constitution</a>. 
            Five years and many ploys later, the people of Ladakh have been denied what was promised to them in the written manifesto of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
        </p>

        <p>
            The reasons for this U-turn are utterly and depressingly predictable. The sixth schedule will allow Ladakh to govern itself through autonomous district and regional councils. These councils have jurisdictions over matters of land, forest and even local culture. 
            This will throw a wrench in the government’s plans to ‘develop’ Ladakh the way it sees fit. If other places, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV4vZo6A-Ak">Manipur and Hasdeo are any indication of the government’s intentions</a>, the fruits of this development would be reaped by corporations, leaving destitute, the forests and the local flora and fauna.
        </p>

        <p>
            When talks with the government broke down, Sonam Wangchuk took his personal mix of educator and climate activism and mixed it with the Gandhian politics of ahimsa- non-violence. He vowed to do a twenty-one day climate fast, surviving only on salt and water, to protest against the falsehood of the government and bring attention to the vulnerability of Ladakh- politically, economically and environmentally. Thousands joined him in solidarity, many fasting with him under the open skies in freezing temperatures. 
            He ended his 21-day fast on March 27 but said that his fight will continue until Ladakh gets what it was promised.
        </p>

        

            <p>
                Ladakh's beauty has been protected partly by its remoteness and the fact that it is a cold desert. It is inhabited by a small population of 300,000, which relies entirely on glacial melt water for its water supply. But, glaciers are melting faster than ever before.

            <p>A report from the <a href="https://hkh.icimod.org/hi-wise/">International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development</a> in Kathmandu finds that glaciers in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya mountain range region melted 65 percent faster from 2010 through 2019 than in the previous decade.</p>

            <p>"Ladakh and its glacier system is [part of what is] known as the “third pole” of the planet. It’s the largest reservoir of fresh water outside of the poles, feeding one fourth of the planet’s population, directly or indirectly," says Wangchuk.</p>

        <p>Wangchuk has been vocal about sustainable living and espousing the integration of these principles in the education system for decades now. An engineer and echo-architect, he has been the recipient of several national and international awards, including the Ramon Magsasay award in 2018. 
        </p>

        <p>
            His flair for sustainable solutions for mountainous regions, make him something of a local savior. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za-f5EmFT5U">His innovations have drawn international attention.</a> 
            In 2013, he came up with the concept of an <a href="http://icestupa.org">Ice Stupa </a> to alleviate the water crisis in Ladakh. When spring rolls around, and farmers need water for irrigation in the months of April and May, the shortage in the cold desert feels particularly acute. 
            The problem is getting worse with climate change and receding glaciers in the Himalayas.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ice Stupas make use of the steady and mostly unused supply of winter water in the streams to store it in vertical structures resembling a stupa. As the stupa melts in spring, it provides water for irrigation. The conception of the Ice Stupa is easy to understand. It is based on the principle that water maintains its level. A pipe is used with an inlet upstream and an outlet at the base of the stupa site. Due to the difference in heights of the inlet and outlet, water at the outlet rises up to the height of the source. As the water gushes out, it freezes immediately upon contacting the cold air of -20 to -50 degrees celsius. This process naturally results in the formation of the stupa in its observed shape and form. Their geometric shape and size ensures that they don't melt until late spring. 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD7gF9Qav40">Each Ice Stupa can irrigate roughly 25 acres of land.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Wangchuk also founded The Students’ Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh (SECMOL) in 1988 with the goal of improving the state of education in Ladakh. It is espoused as “not a conventional school, but a place to pursue practical, environmental, social and traditional knowledge, values and skills.” The campus is solar-powered and emits no carbon-dioxide. They also grow their own organic food and involve the students in dairy farming and preserving food for the colder winter months. Their toilets eschew water and use a composting method that provides manure for their apricot and apple trees. Wastewater from the kitchen and bathroom is utilized for watering plants. 

        </p>

        <p>
            His tryst with education reform also blossomed into the Himalayan Institute for Alternatives, Ladakh (HIAL). It is based on the principles of contextual, experiential and trans-disciplinary learning. Based on similar sustainability principles as SECMOL, there are several schools under HIAL from architecture and sustainable tourism to high-altitude desert ecology.

        <p>
            His daily videos on YouTube and Instagram during the climate-fast, combined the genres of 2-minute science explaining the local weather conditions using a glass of water, climate education, and appeal to the citizens and politicians. In a nation that has recently grown deeply divided, his voice of balance, calm and hopefulness feels fresh and encouraging. One cannot help but draw parallels between him and Gandhi.
            His philosophy is similar too. He says (translated) that "It is not about dying for your country, it is about dedicating your life to it."
            His success is crucial for the mountains and the people who live there.
