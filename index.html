    <h1>Hi, I am Shivangi Bishnoi (she/her).

      I used to be an economist and almost got a PhD in the field after working at the IMF for a little while. I love economics and I love writing and I had always wished to reach a wider readership than academia affords. 
      
      I am passionate about making not just economics, but all sciences better understood by those who are not producing it. If you have a numbers project that you are struggling with or are interested in chatting about how journalists can cover academic/ scientific research better, please email me. 
      
      I moonlight as a writer of fiction and occasionally poetry. I am also a certified yoga teacher and rarely let a day go by when I donâ€™t get on the mat. In my future work, I hope to marry the math to the poetry that lives inside of me.</h1>
