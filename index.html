      I am a data journalism student at Columbia Universityâ€™s Graduate School of Journalism.
      <br>
      I like to find stories in numbers that are not always obvious. 
      <br>
      But I also like to use words and graphics to put numbers into perspective for those who prefer As and Bs to Alphas and Betas.

      I used to be an economist and almost got a PhD in the field. 
      <br>
      I have previously put on many hats including that of an instructor at NYU Abu Dhabi, consultant at the World Bank, and economist at the IMF. 
      <br>
      <br>

      I am passionate about making not just economics, but all sciences better understood by those who are not producing it.
      
      <br>
      So, if you have a numbers project that you are struggling with or are interested in chatting about how journalists can cover academic/ scientific research better, please email me.

         <br>
      I moonlight as a writer of fiction and occasionally poetry. I am also a certified yoga teacher.
      <br>
      In my future work, I hope to marry the math to the poetry that lives inside of me.
